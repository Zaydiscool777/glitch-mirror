      … is a somewhat codegolf-y 2D esolang based on conveyor belts, that will
      push values around in a factory.
    </p>
    Example programs:
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Sum of a list</td>
          <td>
            <code>
              }<br />
              {/+?<br />
              &gt;,^<br />
            </code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>All Fibboncci numbers</td>
          <td>
            <code>
              1"&lt;<br />
              "+1<br />
              }<br />
            </code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Return only odd numbers</td>
          <td>
            <code>
              {"v<br />
              2|!}<br />
            </code>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Values and constants</h2>

    <p>
      There are three type of values: Numbers, characters and default values
      represented as <kbd>_</kbd>. A list is just a collection of values that
      are next to each other. Default values behave based on the function they
      are pushed into, f.e. <kbd>_</kbd> into <kbd>+</kbd> is 0,
      <kbd>_</kbd> into <kbd>*</kbd> is 1. Numbers and characters can be used
      interchangeably and will be casted to and from their ASCII value, though
      the resulting type will be the one of the main port. There can be only one
      value on a tile (exceptions are <kbd>&</kbd> and <kbd>~.</kbd>, which can
      queue values).
    </p>

    <p>
      Strings are enclosed within single quotes, f.e.
      <code>'Hello World!'</code>. If numbers, strings or <kbd>_</kbd> are at a
      start of a conveyor belt line, they are generators and will produce their
      respective value whenever possible. If they are in the middle of a
      conveyor belt line, they are placed there at the initialization of the
      factory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program halts when no value moved last step and no value is waiting
      with <kbd>~</kbd>.
    </p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>
      Every function has a fixed number of input and output ports, f.e.
      <kbd>+</kbd> has 2 inputs and 1 output. Conveyor belt directions are
      inferred to connect each input to an output port. A program that is
      ambigious is erroneous. In this case, the conveyor belt operators are, as
      needed: <kbd>&gt; v &lt; ^</kbd>. They output into the direction they are
      pointing to and take exactly one input from any other direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      All functions operate simultaneously. All functions, if not otherwise
      specified, will only consume and produce blocks if every input port has a
      value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many functions have 3 ports: 2 of the same type, and 1 of the opposing
      type. Whenever there are 2 ports of the same type, there is a distinction
      between the main and the side port. <kbd>-</kbd> has 2 input ports and 1
      output port. When both input ports have values, it will output the main
      port value minus the side port value. Or, in otherwords, "x - y".
    </p>

      <table>
        <caption>Port order for input and output</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Input:</th>
            <th>Output:</th>
            <th>Example 1</th>
            <th>Example 2</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>

              <div>&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              <div>9</div>
              <div>v</div>
              <div>-&gt;}</div>
              <div>^</div>
              <div>7</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              <div>&nbsp; }</div>
              <div>&nbsp; ^</div>
              <div>8&gt;?&gt;}</div>
            </td>
          </tr>

      </table>
    
    A dot `.` in a function's output will alter the function.
