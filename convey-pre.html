      … is a somewhat codegolf-y 2D esolang based on conveyor belts, that will
      push values around in a factory.
    </p>
    Example programs:
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Sum of a list</td>
          <td>
            <code>
              }<br />
              {/+?<br />
              &gt;,^<br />
            </code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>All Fibboncci numbers</td>
          <td>
            <code>
              1"&lt;<br />
              "+1<br />
              }<br />
            </code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Return only odd numbers</td>
          <td>
            <code>
              {"v<br />
              2|!}<br />
            </code>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Values and constants</h2>

    <p>
      There are three type of values: Numbers, characters and default values
      represented as <kbd>_</kbd>. A list is just a collection of values that
      are next to each other. Default values behave based on the function they
      are pushed into, f.e. <kbd>_</kbd> into <kbd>+</kbd> is 0,
      <kbd>_</kbd> into <kbd>*</kbd> is 1. Numbers and characters can be used
      interchangeably and will be casted to and from their ASCII value, though
      the resulting type will be the one of the main port. There can be only one
      value on a tile (exceptions are <kbd>&</kbd> and <kbd>~.</kbd>, which can
      queue values).
    </p>

    <p>
      Strings are enclosed within single quotes, f.e. <code>'Hello World!'</code>. If
      numbers, strings or <kbd>_</kbd> are at a start of a conveyor belt line, they are
      generators and will produce their respective value whenever possible. If
      they are in the middle of a conveyor belt line, they are placed there at
      the initialization of the factory.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The program halts when no value moved last step and no value is waiting
      with `~`.
