… is a somewhat codegolf-y 2D esolang based on conveyor belts, that
will push values around in a factory.
<br><br>
Example programs:
<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Sum of a list</td>
    <td><code>
   }<br>
{/+?<br>
 &gt;,^<br>
      </code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>All Fibboncci numbers</td>
    <td><code>
1"&lt;<br>
"+1<br>
}<br>
      </code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Return only odd numbers</td>
    <td><code>
{"v<br>
2|!}<br>
      </code></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Values and constants</h2>

There are three type of values: Numbers, characters and default values
represented as <kbd>_</kbd>. A list is just a collection of values that are
next to each other.  Default values behave based on the function they
are pushed into, f.e. <kbd>_</kbd> into <kbd>+</kbd> is 0, <kbd>_</kbd> into <kbd>*</kbd> is 1. Numbers and
characters can be used interchangeably and will be casted to and from
their ASCII value, though the resulting type will be the one of the
main port. There can be only one value on a tile (exceptions are <kbd>&</kbd>
and <kbd>~.</kbd>, which can queue values).
